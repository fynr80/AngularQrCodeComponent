## Github Pages & Angular

It was kinda tricky to start a live site with Angular and github.
the solution was Angular CLI gh-pages.

$ng build --configuration production --base-href "https://username.github.io/reponame/" --deploy-url "https://username.github.io/reponame/"
$npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/Project-name

- Mobile: 375px
